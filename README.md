# SortSpectrum
A visual tour of sorting algorithms
This is a web-based sorting algorithm visualizer that allows users to interactively observe and learn various sorting algorithms. The visualizer provides real-time animations and step-by-step demonstrations of popular sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of sorting algorithms
- Multiple sorting algorithms to choose from
- Real-time animations and step-by-step demonstrations
- Support for custom datasets and adjustable array sizes
- Compare mode for simultaneous visualization of multiple algorithms
- Learning mode for code input and visualization based on user-defined algorithms
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## Demo

You can access the live demo of the sorting algorithm visualizer at [Demo Link](https://your-demo-link.com).

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Java Spring Framework and Java MVC Framework
- D3.js for creating dynamic and interactive visualizations


## Installation and Usage

To run this, follow these steps:
1. Start the Spring Boot application by running the main class “Application.java”.
2. Once the application is up and running, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the visualization interface.
3. The visualization consists of a bar chart and a list of sorting steps. Click the "Sort" button to initiate the sorting process.
4. The bars in the chart represent the values to be sorted, and the heights of the bars indicate their relative magnitudes.
5. As the sorting algorithm progresses, the chart will update to show the changes made at each step. The list of steps on the right provides a textual representation of the sorting process.
6. You can also pause the sorting process by clicking the "Pause" button if needed, increase or decrease the speed by the slider.
7. You can see the comparison between two algorithms.
8. You can also write your code to check you knowledge about sorting algorithms. There are steps to teach each line of code.
